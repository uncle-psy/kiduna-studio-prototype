          <p>
            This End User License Agreement and Terms of Service
            (&ldquo;EULA&rdquo; or &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) is a binding contract
            between you, an individual user or site visitor, whether personally
            or on behalf of an entity (&ldquo;user,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;your&rdquo;) and Kiduna Club (&ldquo;Kiduna,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;KC,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;our&rdquo;) concerning use of our services (the
            &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), including this website as well as any other
            media form, media channel, agent, app or mobile website related,
            linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the
            &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). KC maintains and operates the Site as an opt-in
            service for creating, promoting and enjoying token-gated AI
            &ldquo;agents&rdquo; and member-governed organizations. For the
            avoidance of doubt, KC does not control the Kiduna Protocol
            (&ldquo;KP&rdquo;) on which we operate, nor Telegram, Gmail, Bluesky
            or any other systems, networks, apps, protocols, devices or
            platforms on which we might appear. KC cannot control activity and
            data on KP, the activities of persons who develop and use
            applications on KP, the distribution of royalties on KP, or use of
            KP. KP is an open-source protocol. Any third party may develop
            applications, protocols, networks and services that use KP, so our
            tokens and other materials may appear in various contexts outside
            our control.

            made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised EULA

          <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            Please read the following section carefully because it requires you
            to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with KC and limits the
            manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of
            arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class
            or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this
            arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from
            suing in court or having a jury trial.
          </p>
          <p>
            (a) <b>No Representative Actions.</b> You and KC agree that any
            dispute arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service is
            personal to you and KC and that any dispute will be resolved solely
            through individual action, and will not be brought as a class
            arbitration, class action or any other type of representative
            proceeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            (b) <b>Arbitration of Disputes.</b> You and KC waive your rights to
            a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related
            to this EULA and the Service, including claims related to privacy
            and data security, (collectively, &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) resolved
            in court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against KC you
            agree to first contact KC and attempt to resolve the claim
            informally by sending a written notice of your claim
            (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) to KC by email at support@kinship.systems or
            by US mail addressed to Kiduna Club, P.O. Box 2085, Shepherdstown,
            WV 25443. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address,
            email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and
            basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought.
            Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above.
            If you and KC cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute
            within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either
            party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by
            JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court.
            All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through
            confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration
            proceedings will be held in Martinsburg, WV. You and KC agree that
            Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
            Arbitration Rules and Procedures (&ldquo;JAMS Rules&rdquo;). The
            most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS
            website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either
            acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS
            Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any
            claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any
            reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            (c) You and KC agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and
            that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and
            procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
            &sect; 1, et seq. (the &ldquo;FAA&rdquo;), to the maximum extent
            permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and
            the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make
            all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and
            to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court,
            including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The
            arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not
            consolidate more than one individual&rsquo;s claims, preside over
            any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any
            proceeding involving more than one individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of
            non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator,
            KC, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration
            proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered,
            prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to
            the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to
            make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the
            law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not
            apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or
            conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a
            court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a
            judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to
            the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial
            decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            (e) You and KC agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will
            pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer),
            and KC will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any
            arbitration initiated by KC, KC will pay all JAMS fees and costs.
            You and KC agree that the State of West Virginia shall have
            exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an
            arbitration award.
          </p>
          <p>
            (f) Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant
            claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which
            means that you and KC will not have the right to assert the claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            (g) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30
            days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by
            mailing an opt-out notice to KC at P.O. Box 2085, Shepherdstown, WV
            25443. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include
            your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt
            out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration,
            you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the
            governing law and venue terms of this EULA.
          </p>
          <p>
            (h) If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or
            unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision
            shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the
            unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever
            on the remainder of this Section or the parties&rsquo; ability to
            compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis
            pursuant to this Section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must
            therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or
            representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court
            of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties
            agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the
            outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any
            part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual claim
            seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect
            to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of
            arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.
          </p>
